joblib
Purpose:
joblib is used for serializing (saving) and deserializing (loading) the trained machine learning model (a RandomForestClassifier in this case).

Why not pickle?
Scikit-learn models often contain large numpy arrays. joblib is optimized for efficiently handling such objects, making it faster and more memory-efficient than Python's built-in pickle module for this use case.


pathlib
Purpose:
pathlib provides an object-oriented interface for working with filesystem paths. It simplifies path manipulation (e.g., joining paths, checking file existence).

In the Code:
While the code imports pathlib, it doesnâ€™t explicitly use it. The current implementation uses os.path.join for path operations, which is a valid approach.

Why include pathlib then?
It might be a leftover from an earlier version of the code where pathlib was used (e.g., Path(...).resolve()). In the current code, pathlib is redundant and can safely be removed.
